    <p class="drop">Hey Krittika, happy 1 year dating-aversary. 
      Sorry I couldn't make it up there to be with you, 
      but hopefully this makes up for it. I know how much it 
      means to you, so I wanted to do something special and 
      this was the best way I knew how. Hopefully you enjoy the flowers. Looking forward to seeing you this Christmas!</p>
